# Tool Design as Harness Surface

Tools are the agent's action surface, and their descriptions are the routing logic. **This
is where most harnesses leak.**

Where [[Tool Design as Context Engineering]] treats tools as consumers of window space,
this page treats them as a harness contract: what ships in the definition, and which
properties decide whether a tool needs a gate.

## ACI, Not API

Tool design follows **ACI principles — Agent-Computer Interface, not Application
Programming Interface.** A tool is designed for a reader with no documentation, no type
hints, no autocomplete, and **no ability to ask a follow-up question**. It sees a name, a
description, and a parameter schema.

- **Boundaries must be explicit.** Where one tool ends and the next begins has to be legible
  from descriptions alone.
- **Parameters must be error-proof.** Prefer enums over free strings, absolute paths over
  relative, required over optional-with-surprising-default.
- **Examples belong inside the definition**, not in external docs. *Content invisible to the
  agent is non-existent.*

> When a tool is used wrongly, **check the tool description before questioning the model's
> capability.**

See [[ACI (Agent-Computer Interface)]].

## The Clarity Test

> **"If a human engineer can't definitively say which tool should be used in a given
> situation, an AI agent can't be expected to do better."**

Hand your tool list to a colleague with no context, describe three realistic tasks, and ask
which tool they would reach for. **Every hesitation is a bug in a description or an overlap
that needs collapsing.**

Tools should be *"self-contained, robust to error, and extremely clear with respect to their
intended use."* The dominant failure mode is **bloated tool sets with overlapping
functionality** — and the Terminal Bench gain in [[Harness Engineering]] came partly from
*reducing* tools. **Subtraction is a legitimate optimization.**

## The Five-Section Tool Contract

The structure that turns a one-liner into a decision procedure:

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **What it does** | The operation, plainly |
| **WHEN TO USE** | Positive triggers — the situations this tool owns |
| **WHEN NOT TO USE** | Boundary cases that belong to a neighboring tool |
| **DO NOT USE FOR** | Hard negatives — misuse patterns seen in practice |
| **EXAMPLES** | Concrete invocations with realistic arguments |

**The two negative sections do the heavy lifting.** Positive descriptions alone leave the
model to infer boundaries between similar tools; explicit negatives are what disambiguate
`search` from `grep` from `read`.

Each entry in `DO NOT USE FOR` should be **ratchet output** — traceable to an actual
observed misuse.

Structurally, **separate the contract (schema + description) from the execution logic** via
a factory pattern. Contracts are prompt-engineering artifacts that get iterated on and
versioned; implementations are code. *Coupling them means every wording change touches
executable code.*

## The Four Gating Questions

Ask of every tool before it ships:

1. **Reversible?** — can its effect be undone?
2. **Idempotent?** — is calling it twice the same as once?
3. **Observable?** — does it emit a trace the harness can inspect?
4. **Parallel-safe?** — can two instances run concurrently without corruption?

Each failure has a prescribed remedy:

- Fails **#1** → needs a **confirmation gate**.
- Fails **#2** → must not be retried without an **idempotency key**.
- Fails **#3** → **cannot be debugged**.
- Fails **#4** → must be **serialized in the orchestrator**.

## Schema Rules

- `snake_case` **verb-noun** names — `read_file`, `create_issue`, `send_email`. *The name is
  the first routing signal.*
- **Side effects declared in the description**, not just implied by the name.
- **Typed return structure** — never a bare string when the next step needs to branch on the
  result.
- **Structured errors** with a stable `error_code`, plus `is_fatal` and `retry_after` where
  relevant. **An error the agent can classify is an error it can recover from**; a
  stringly-typed one forces guessing.
- **Token-efficient returns.** Return the answer, not the raw dump — offload the dump to
  disk with a path reference.

Zod or Pydantic schemas give you validation and the model-facing schema from one definition.
Pin versions deliberately.

## Progressive Disclosure: Skills

Loading every tool and MCP server at startup **degrades performance before the agent starts
working** — context is consumed and selection accuracy drops as the candidate set grows.

Skills invert this. A short name and description (*what* + *when*, ~10 tokens) stay
resident; the full procedure loads only when the task activates it. **A capability library
of dozens of skills costs a few hundred tokens at rest.**

Same mechanism as progressive disclosure in [[Context Anatomy]], applied to *capability*
rather than knowledge.

## MCP vs In-Process

| Choose MCP when | Choose in-process when |
|---|---|
| Multiple distinct callers need the capability | Only this agent uses it |
| A security boundary must be crossed | Trust domain is shared |
| It deploys independently | It ships with the agent |
| Discovery matters (tools change at runtime) | The tool set is fixed |
| It holds its own state | It's stateless |

Cost: latency per hop, plus a process to operate. **Default to in-process; promote when one
of the left-hand conditions actually holds** rather than in anticipation. See
[[MCP Protocol]].

## Write-Operation Safety

For anything that mutates, sends, or spends:

1. The description **declares the side effect** explicitly.
2. A **confirmation step** precedes irreversible execution.
3. An **idempotency key** is supplied by the caller so retries are safe.
4. Model-generated inputs are **validated against schema before execution** — tool inputs
   are agent-composed and therefore only semi-trusted. See
   [[Execution Boundaries and Guardrails]].

> Tools without idempotency keys must not be auto-retried. **Retrying a non-idempotent write
> is how one transient timeout becomes three charged invoices.**
