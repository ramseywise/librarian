# Harness Anatomy

The component inventory of [[Harness Engineering]]: what ships inside a harness, and which
primitives are foundational rather than optional.

## The Nine Components

### Knowledge and configuration

**1. System prompts and context policies** — behavioral framing, plus the *rules for what
gets assembled* per call. **The policy is harness; the assembled result is context.**

**2. Tools, skills, and MCPs — and their descriptions** — the action surface. Descriptions
are load-bearing: they are the *only* thing the model sees at selection time. Skills add
progressive disclosure so a large capability library does not flood the window at startup.
See [[Tool Design as Harness Surface]].

### Infrastructure

**3. Filesystem abstractions** — *"arguably the most foundational harness primitive."*
Durable storage, context offloading, cross-session persistence, and a shared medium for
multi-agent handoff.

**4. Bash and code execution** — the general-purpose escape hatch.

**5. Sandboxes** — safe execution environments with pre-configured tooling. See
[[Execution Boundaries and Guardrails]].

**6. Memory systems** — file-based standards (`AGENTS.md`, `MEMORY.md`) for continual
learning across sessions. See [[Memory as Context]].

### Orchestration and control

**7. Orchestration logic** — subagent spawning, handoffs, model routing, HITL feedback
loops. See [[Harness Orchestration]].

**8. Hooks / middleware** — deterministic control flow: compaction, continuation, lint
checks, verification gates. **The part of the harness that cannot be talked out of
enforcing itself.**

**9. Context management tools** — web search, retrieval, and MCP access for information past
the training cutoff; plus compaction and tool-output offloading.

Supporting: git versioning, planning files, test runners, self-verification hooks.

## Why the Filesystem Is Foundational

It is the primitive the others lean on, because it solves four problems at once:

| Problem | Filesystem answer |
|---|---|
| Context window is finite | Offload large outputs to disk; keep a reference in-window |
| Sessions end | Plans, notes, and state survive as files |
| Subagents need to hand off | A file is a shared, inspectable medium |
| Work needs auditing | Git gives you history, diff, and rollback for free |

This is the mechanism behind **state externalization** ([[Long-Horizon Execution]]) —
progress lives in files, so the loop becomes re-entrant and independent of any single
context window.

It is also the mechanism behind **tool-call offloading**: keep the head and tail of a large
tool output in-window above a token threshold, write the full output to disk, and let the
model read it back only if needed. *A 2,000-line log becomes ~40 lines plus a path.*

**Git deserves separate mention: it is the only rollback mechanism most harnesses have.**
Branch-per-agent turns parallel experimentation into a safe operation with a free undo.

## Bash as a General-Purpose Tool

The design bet: **you cannot pre-design every tool an agent will need.**

Harnesses ship a bash tool so the model can compose solutions by writing and executing
code, rather than being limited to the API surface someone anticipated. A curated tool set
handles known operations well; bash handles the long tail.

The tension is real — bash is maximally capable and maximally dangerous, which is exactly
why it must be paired with a sandbox and hooks. The **promote-from-bash heuristic**
resolves it:

> Start with shell; promote to a typed tool when you need a **gate**, a **rendered result**,
> an **audit record**, **parallelism**, or a **retry policy**.

## The Layered Mental Model

```
┌─ Deterministic shell ──────────────────────────┐  hooks, permissions,
│  ┌─ Orchestration ──────────────────────────┐  │  schema validation
│  │  ┌─ The loop ─────────────────────────┐  │  │  (cannot be argued with)
│  │  │  ┌─ Context assembly ──────────┐   │  │  │
│  │  │  │   [ model call ]            │   │  │  │
│  │  │  └─────────────────────────────┘   │  │  │
│  │  │   tool execution · verification    │  │  │
│  │  └────────────────────────────────────┘  │  │
│  │   subagents · handoffs · model routing   │  │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
│   sandbox · filesystem · git · observability   │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Two rules read straight off the diagram:

1. **Reliability requirements move outward.** Anything that must hold every time belongs in
   the deterministic shell, not in a sentence inside the model call. *A prompt can be
   ignored; a hook cannot.*
2. **Cost and blast radius grow outward too.** Adding a sentence is cheap and reversible;
   adding a subagent tier multiplies tokens and loses cross-agent context. **Reach for the
   innermost layer that can actually hold the requirement.**

## The Causal Build Order

A 38-lesson harness curriculum organized so that *"each step exists because the previous one
broke something."* That ordering is the best available answer to **what to build first**:

| # | Module | The break it answers |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The agent loop | A chatbot can't act |
| 2 | Tool design | The model picks the wrong tool |
| 3 | System prompt | Behavior is inconsistent across runs |
| 4 | Sandbox abstraction | Execution is unsafe / environment-coupled |
| 5 | Context management | Tokens grow unbounded in long sessions |
| 6 | Subagent delegation | One context can't hold the whole task |
| 7 | Sandbox lifecycle | Cloud sandboxes cost money while idle |
| 8 | Human-in-the-loop | The agent guesses when it should ask |
| 9 | Planning and verification | Work is declared done without being checked |
| 10 | Surfaces | The same agent needs CLI and web |
| 11 | Extensibility | Adding a tool means editing the core |

Note the shape: **capability first (1–4), then the constraints that make capability
survivable at scale (5–9), then productization (10–11).** Teams that invert this — building
orchestration before verification — produce the Stage-0-claiming-Stage-2 failure in
[[Harness Maturity and Failure Modes]].

Two design principles worth lifting out:

- **"Swap the backend, the tools don't change."** The `Sandbox` interface is uniform; local
  `fs`/`child_process`, in-memory copy-on-write, and remote cloud sandboxes are
  interchangeable behind it. **Tools bind to the interface, never the backend.**
- **Extensibility without core edits.** Event buses, a tool registry, and progressive skill
  disclosure mean adding capability is *registration, not surgery*.

## Minimum Viable Harness

Cutting the inventory to what a first real harness needs:

1. A **tool loop** with typed schemas
2. A **sandbox** (even just a working-directory boundary)
3. A **filesystem** the agent can read and write
4. A **plan file** for anything past ~5 steps
5. One **verification gate** with a binary pass/fail
6. **Structured traces** of every step

Six items. Everything else here is elaboration on those.
