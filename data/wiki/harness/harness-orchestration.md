# Harness Orchestration

> Subagents are a context management technique before they are an architecture. Treat the
> second as a consequence of the first.

## Subagents as Context Firewall

The primary justification is not division of labor — it is **context isolation**.

> Sub-agents function as a **context firewall**: discrete tasks run in isolated windows so
> intermediate noise never accumulates in the parent thread responsible for orchestration.

A search that reads 40 files and finds 3 relevant ones should return **the 3, not the 40**.
The subagent absorbs the exploration; the orchestrator receives a condensed summary
(**~1,000–2,000 tokens**). The parent stays coherent far longer than it otherwise could —
which makes this a direct instrument of [[Long-Horizon Execution]].

*"When working on hard problems that require many, many context windows to solve, sub-agents
are the key to maintaining coherency across many sessions."*

The settled default:

> **Orchestrator holds the plan; subagents hold the details.**

## Protocols Precede Collaboration

> **Establish a task graph and isolation boundaries *before* introducing parallelism.**

Parallelism added to an undefined task structure produces **collision, not speed**. Define
what each agent owns, what it receives, what it returns, and what it may touch — then
parallelize.

Isolate is also the **most expensive of the four context levers** (see
[[Context Engineering]]): real tokens multiply and cross-agent context is lost. Reach for it
when a genuine context or trust boundary exists, **not for tidiness**.

## Role-Based Separation

From cheapest to most involved:

### Explorer / Executor

| Role | Tools | Model | Context |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Explorer** | Read-only | Cheaper | Isolated, disposable |
| **Executor** | Full | Stronger | Holds the plan |

Read-only exploration is safe and parallelizable, so it can run cheap and wide.
**Constraining the tool set *per role* is the point** — the explorer physically cannot
mutate anything. That is a grant, not a label; see
[[Execution Boundaries and Guardrails]].

### Planner / Executor

Splits decomposition from implementation. The fix for *"the agent got lost in a 40-step
task."*

### Generator / Evaluator

Splits production from judgment — the structural answer to self-evaluation bias. See
[[Verification Loops]].

### Full Pipeline

One reported harness runs a role chain end to end: **Orchestrator → PO-Spec → Feature Design
→ Tech Lead → Build → QA**, with three supporting concepts:

- **Roles** — behavioral definitions holding each agent's logic, prerequisites, constraints,
  and process.
- **Artifacts** — concrete deliverables from each agent, **tagged with task IDs for
  traceability**.
- **Workflow standards** — governance covering technology practice, inter-agent
  communication, and state tracking.

Because artifacts are stored and indexed by task ID they become a **searchable historical
record**: past implementations serve as reference patterns for future work (*reuse the
pagination approach from task 214*).

> **Multi-agent state that persists is organizational memory, not just plumbing.**

## Graph-Based Orchestration

Google's ADK 2.0 replaces ad-hoc Python loops with **structured, declarative, graph-based
primitives**. The harness becomes a **topology** rather than control flow buried in code.

| Primitive | Role |
|---|---|
| **Agent** | Model definition, instructions, state target mappings |
| **`@node`** | Arbitrary Python — deterministic computation, tool calls, classification |
| **Edge** | Declarative routing based on state values or return codes |
| **JoinNode** | Synchronization barrier — blocks until parallel branches complete |

### Typed state

Pydantic schemas replace unstructured dictionaries:

```python
class GatewayContext(BaseModel):
    raw_payload: str = ""
    detected_language: str = "UNKNOWN"
```

ADK **validates inputs and outputs at node boundaries**, so key errors surface at the
boundary rather than three nodes downstream. Schema inheritance lets base configurations
extend across workflows.

This is *encode constraints, don't document them* applied to orchestration: **the contract
between agents is enforced, not documented.**

### Event-driven routing

Nodes return `Event` objects carrying routing instructions:

```python
return Event(actions=EventActions(route="loop_back"))
```

The engine evaluates and executes the matching edge. This **decouples node logic from graph
topology** — a node states its *outcome*; the graph decides what that means. Rewiring the
workflow doesn't touch node code.

### Subgraph composition

ADK 2.0 treats **compiled workflows as first-class nodes**, so self-contained sub-flows nest
inside higher-level coordinators — the same composition property that makes functions
useful, applied to agent graphs.

## Multi-Agent Failure Modes

| Failure | Shape | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **Loop oscillation** | Two nodes bounce work between them indefinitely | Iteration counters on cyclic edges; forced escalation |
| **Context pollution** | Nested workflows leak state upward, defeating isolation | Explicit boundary schemas; return summaries only |
| **Concurrency collision** | Parallel branches write the same state or file | JoinNode barriers; per-branch ownership of state keys |
| **Consensus deadlock** | Reviewer agents never agree, blocking progress | Tie-break rule, majority threshold, or a final arbiter |

**All four are harness bugs. None is fixed by a better model**, and all four get worse as
agent count rises — which is the practical argument for **keeping agent counts as low as the
task allows**.

## Handoff Design

What crosses a boundary is the whole design:

- **Structured, not prose.** A typed schema — findings, files touched, confidence, open
  questions — beats a paragraph.
- **Summaries, never transcripts.** Sending a subagent's full history back **defeats the
  firewall**.
- **State on disk, references in the message.** Large artifacts go to files; the handoff
  carries paths. See [[Long-Horizon Execution]].
- **Declare what was *not* done.** Scoped claims prevent the orchestrator from assuming
  coverage that doesn't exist.

## When *Not* to Go Multi-Agent

Multi-agent is the expensive option. **Single agent with verification is the correct
default**; escalate only when:

- **Context genuinely doesn't fit** — the firewall argument, the strongest reason.
- **Roles need different tools or trust levels** — read-only explorer, sandboxed executor.
- **Self-evaluation bias is the blocker** — you need an external evaluator.
- **Branches are genuinely independent** — real parallelism, not sequential work in costume.

Absent one of these, added agents multiply token cost and introduce the four failure modes
while solving nothing. In order of increasing cost: **single agent with verification →
two-agent supervisor → multi-agent with a shared harness layer.**
